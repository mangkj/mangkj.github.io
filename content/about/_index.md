### Work History
I am currently a **Quantitative Trader** at **GSR Markets**, a sell-side crypto market-maker, in *Singapore*. My team runs the systematic spot market-making desk, but we also do options market-making and provide liquidation services for clients. 

My day-to-day involves monitoring engine performance and adjusting trading parameters to maximize profit without compromising on client obligations. As a team, we manage the risk, margin utilization and liquidity of the books and handle all trading-related decisions/questions. We build automation tools in Python to cut down the manual labor required to run the BAU and build/run data analysis tools to help us optimize engine settings.

Before that I was an **Options Trader** at **Maverick Derivatives** in the *Netherlands*. I traded volatility dispersion in US Equity options, specifically trading the volatility of tech/software/gold-mining ETFs against their components. We had to constantly search for trading opportunities or find ways to reduce trading costs. There, I also built lots of automated software in Python, including webscrapers, Slack/email alerts, trading UIs.

My first job was a **Quantitative Researcher** at **Bloomberg LP** n the QFR team led by Bruno Dupire in New York City. The projects there focused heavily on data visualization, applying mathematical methods to finance and improving various Bloomberg datasets. Whilst at Bloomberg, I also wrote 3 short mathematical papers (published on SSRN and ResearchGate) inspired by the conversations I had with my colleagues.
