Hello,

I'm Michael Ang (formally Ang Kun Joo Michael), a Quantitative Trader currently living in Singapore. I love mathematics, languages, solving difficult problems, learning new things, experiencing discomfort and going on adventures. On this site I post articles on various things I've done: travels, artwork, sport, hobbies, etc.

For business visitors, here are links to my [CV](/Resume_Kun_Joo_Michael_Ang.pdf) and [SSRN profile]("https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=4451864"). You may also wish to view my ['About'](/about "About page") page.

Otherwise, feel free to check out my [hobbies](/hobbies "Hobbies page") page (fun stuff) or read some of my [posts](/posts "Longer Writings").
